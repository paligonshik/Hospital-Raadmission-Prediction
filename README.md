# Hospital-Raadmission-Prediction
For the course project, I will investigate the problem of predicting readmission of hospital patients.


# Project Name
This project is a part of the Data Science Foundation Course at [RIT](https://rit.edu/).  
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is detecting patients who will come back after first admission in hospitals. Readmission of patients following discharge from hospital places an enormous and very expensive burden on the US healthcare system (estimated at $40B in 2011)
Besides administration of hospitals might also be concerned what factors make cause readmission. Keeping that in mind I will try to present feature importances as well.

## Getting Started

1. Raw Data is being kept within this repo. By the name of _diabetic_data.csv_
    
2. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/paligonshik/Hospital-Raadmission-Prediction/blob/main/part1.ipynb)
3. [Modeling](https://github.com/paligonshik/Hospital-Raadmission-Prediction/blob/main/part2.ipynb)
